# üü¢ Zealthy Onboarding Exercise üü¢
A custom multi-step onboarding application built for Zealthy that allows users to sign up and provide personal information through a configurable step-by-step process.

### User Flow
- **Step 1**: Email and password authentication  
- **Step 2**: Configurable fields (About Me, Address, and/or Date of Birth)  
- **Step 3**: Additional configurable fields (About Me, Address, and/or Date of Birth)  
- **Success Page**: Completion confirmation with data viewing options

Also included a header to navigate to the **Sign In**, **Data**, and **Admin** pages.

## Tech Stack

### üîπ Frontend
- Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, & React Context API

### üîπ Backend
- Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM, PostgresSQL, Supabase

## Main Form Components
- **About Me** ‚Äì Text area for user description  
- **Address** ‚Äì Street, City, State, Zip fields  
- **Date of Birth** ‚Äì Date picker input

Note: these are conditionally rendered based on admin configuration.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Some Limitations

- No form input validation  
- No session management (e.g., tokens or cookies)

- Not scalable (e.g., lacks caching, error handling)  
- No testing coverage, no unit tests
